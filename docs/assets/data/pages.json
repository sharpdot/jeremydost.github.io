    "body": "<p>Jeremy Dost is a painter of expressive figures and landscapes. There is an affinity for vast spaces and a warm light in all of his work which comes from the Florida landscape where he grew up. His passion for art began as a teenager in classes at the local art center, where Florida painter Christopher Still mentored him. This passion led him to the Atlanta College of Art where he majored in painting, graduating in 1995 with a Bachelor of Fine Art degree. At ACA, Jeremy had the opportunity to work with artists such as Rocio Rodriquez, Alan Loehle, Fred Gregory, Deanna Sirlin, David Pettrow, and Jena Jones. It was also during this time that he first began exhibiting his work.</p>\n<p>These first exhibits included many juried school shows and artist-organized exhibitions around Atlanta. After moving to New York City in 1999 his work was exhibited in numerous group and solo shows, primarily in Brooklyn where he lived.</p>\n<p>Along with showing his work, Jeremy has been involved in the founding of several artist communities and organizations; a passion that continues with Arts Beacon!</p>"
